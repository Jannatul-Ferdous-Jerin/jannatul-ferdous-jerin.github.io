As part of our academic coursework, my classmate and I conducted a field-based research project on the August
2024 flash flood. We surveyed and interviewed affected individuals and families to assess socioeconomic
vulnerabilities, hydrometeorological triggers, and levels of community preparedness and response. I prepared the
questionnaire for the survey, which guided our data collection process. Using both qualitative and quantitative
methods, we analyzed patterns of exposure, adaptive capacity, and disaster impacts.
