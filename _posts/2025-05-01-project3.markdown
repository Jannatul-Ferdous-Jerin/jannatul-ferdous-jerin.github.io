Analyzing the climatological characteristics of tropical cyclones over the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to 2023. The
analysis examines cyclone genesis location distribution, frequency patterns on annual, seasonal, monthly, and
decadal scales, along with cyclone duration and landfall locations. By capturing both spatial and temporal variability,
the study highlights long-term trends and shifts in tropical cyclone behavior in this region.
