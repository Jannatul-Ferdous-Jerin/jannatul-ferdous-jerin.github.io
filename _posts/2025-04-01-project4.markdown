Simulated the structure, intensity, landfall, and track of Tropical Cyclone “Mocha” using the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model. Key atmospheric parameters such as temperature, mean sea-level pressure, surface
fluxes, wind speed, vorticity, relative humidity, convergence, divergence, and vertical wind shear were analyzed to
understand the processes driving cyclone formation and intensification. The simulated outputs were validated
against observational data for track, minimum central pressure, and maximum wind speed. The findings provide
valuable insights into the model’s performance and demonstrate its applicability in forecasting high-impact tropical
cyclone events.
